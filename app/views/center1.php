<ul>
<li class='product'><u>Personalized, customized AI:</u> Neural network inputs, like vital statistics, and device state, and local calculations, et.al., are available through device sensors, and device software calculations, and externally networked data sources. The networks are customized to specialize with user generated input.</li>
<li><u>Cooperative, Networked, Anonymous, AI Crowd Networks:</u> Neural networks can be anonymously networked via WebRTC (using Software2.0's proprietary Javascript networking algorithm) to provide new nodes with valuable pre-trained networks, and training on remote data, and normalization of trained models.</li><li><u>Unlimited scalability:</u> The speed and efficiency and adaptability of Software2.0's solutions can provide corporate clients with neural networks of scales surpassing existing data-center technology. Networks are designed to run on all devices programmable with ECMAScript-5, including Internet browsers, Android apps, and IOT micro-devices; <i>no server required</i>.</li>
